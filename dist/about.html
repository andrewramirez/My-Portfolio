                <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Ramirez. I am currently employed at Comerica Bank as a Credit Specialist. I enjoy
                    all things finance but have a passion for anything technology related. I am a former teacher who is confident
                    in public speaking, teaching, group management and creating curriculum from the ground up. I am a graduate
                    of Central Michigan Unviersity and a recent graduate from Grand Circus Coding Bootcamp in Detroit, Michigan.
                    I specialized in Front-End Web Development and am savy with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Angular.</p>

                <h6>Credit Specialist</h6>
                <p>I collaborate with Relationship Managers, Portfolio Managers, Underwriters and Credit Analysts to manage
                    several cost centers in the Metro Detroit area. My role includes analyzing various company and personal
                    financial statements to determine a client's credit worthiness. Using tax returns, credit reports, audited
                    or self-prepared statements I am able to forecast how a loan will be paid back and with how much risk
                    will be involved. Most recently I have been placed on a team from various credit departments that prepares
                    materials and presentations for new hire trainings. It has been a blast to develop curriculum and activities
                    for future credit specialists to enjoy. .

                <h6>Business Technology Instructor</h6>
                <p>I had the pleasure of teaching 6th, 7th, and 8th grade at Immokalee Middle School. Each class had a mix of
                    grades and each day was a new challenge but I loved every second of it! I taught students on a wide range
                    of subjects from how to properly type on a keyboard to how to build a computer. My main role was teaching
                    students about Microsoft programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. After several weeks of
                    instruction students would take a certification test through a third party vendor and potentially become
                    Microsoft Office Specialists. I was fortunate enough to have the most students in the State of Florida
                    become Microsoft Specialists at the middle school level. I also piloted various curriculum and an after
                    school robotics club that went on to win the 1st annual district S.T.E.A.M competition. </p>
